# Razorpay iOS Sample App
This repository demonstrates how to integrate Razorpay's iOS Framework in Swift.

To run the example app:
Sign up for a Razorpay Account(https://dashboard.razorpay.com/#/access/signin) and generate the API Keys(https://razorpay.com/docs/payment-gateway/dashboard-guide/settings/#api-keys/) from the Razorpay Dashboard.
1. If you haven't already, sign up for a <a href="https://rzp.io/i/TMjXrmK">Razorpay account</a>.
2. Open .xcodeproj with Xcode.
3. Fill in the KEY_ID constant in ./azorpay-ios-sample-app/RazorPay/ViewController.swift with your Razorpay test "key". This key should start with rzp_test.
After this is done, you can make test payments through the app and see them in your Razorpay dashboard.
